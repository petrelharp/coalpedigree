This is python code to simulate whole-genome relatedness among a sample of individuals in populations exchanging migrants and changing sizes.
It works in discrete (nonoverlapping) generations, uses diploid individuals, and makes no further approximations.
It simulates in reverse time.
The running time is strongly dependent on the effective population size -- 
N_e greater that ten thousand or so for more than 50 generations might take prohibitively long (i.e. weeks),
unless the genome is short.

coalpedigree.py -- module
sim-ibd-pedigree.py -- a script to run it
sim-demographics-2.py -- an example input file for sim-ibd-pedigree.py
test-pedigree-sims.py -- various unordered examples for cutting and pasting into the interpreter.

This is not well documented, but is simple, and might be useful to someone.
